\let\bld\boldsymbol

As an example, for two-dimensional Euler equations modelling inviscid fluid flow  ($m=4$), these are
\begin{equation}
\bld{u} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\rho \\ \rho u_1 \\ \rho u_2 \\ \rho e
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\bld{F}_1 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\rho u_1 \\ \rho u_1^2 + p \\ \rho u_1 u_2 \\ u_1 (\rho e + p)
\end{bmatrix}, \,
\bld{F}_2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\rho u_2 \\ \rho u_1 u_2 \\ \rho u_2^2 \\ u_2 (\rho e + p)
\end{bmatrix}.
\label{conservedvectors}
\end{equation}
In the above, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $u_j$ are the velocity components, $e$ is the specific energy, and $p$ is the pressure. The governing equations are closed by the ideal gas equation of state
\begin{equation}
p = \rho (e - \frac12 \vert \bld{u} \vert^2).
\label{constitutive}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Non-dimensionalization}
We assume we know a reference density $\rho_{ref}$, a reference velocity magnitude $v_{ref}$ and a reference length $l_{ref}$. These could be, for example, the free-stream density, the speed of the object in the fluid and the characteristic dimension of the object (like the chord length of an airfoil). Then we define the reference time as $t_{ref} := l_{ref}/v_{ref}$, the reference pressure as $p_{ref} := \rho_{ref}u_{ref}^2$ and the reference specific energy as $e := u_{ref}^2$. With this specification of reference quantities, the non-dimensionalized governing equations look exactly the same as the governing equations \eqref{conservativeGE}, \eqref{conservedvectors} and \eqref{constitutive}.
